  In this project, there is a starting struct of the framework using pattern Page Object for testing Google.com. 
And using this framework was written one test - SimpleSearchTest(), that enters data in the search field and takes a 
screenshot of the result.
  Also, there is one test with the same functionality to previous, but without using any framework - TestSearch(), 
that was written only for example.
